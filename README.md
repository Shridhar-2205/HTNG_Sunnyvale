<b>SmartOne application:</b>

We utilized all the HTNG and Sponsor API web services.  We incorporated the poynt payment portal terminal and its API so that the business traveler (Jane) can have a seamless guest experience at the check-in where she authorizes her corporate credit card and was able to adjust her room environmental settings.  
We utilized the poynt payment terminal to retrieve her preset environment settings and adjust her temperature and light settings into the Oracle OPERA PMS.   In turn, the Oracle OPERA PMS broadcast to individual Nest, Philip Hue smart lights in her room to make it feel like home.  Moreover, we added custom attributes for temperature and lighting in the Oracle OPERA PMS as well as wine reception attendance or wine preference to enhance the guest experience.
